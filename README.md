Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

My name is Fernando Reyes Planes, I am a student from University of Murcia taking Informatic Engineering. ðŸ”§

I am really interested in learning different types of code and coding itself. At the moment studying C++ and learning how to use VS Code.

No projects currently but aiming for them. Learning the basics to develop my skills.
